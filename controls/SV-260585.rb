Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.  
  
Notifications provided by information systems include, for example, electronic alerts to system administrators, messages to local computer consoles, and/or hardware indications, such as lights.

Download the original aide-common package in the /tmp directory:  
  
     $ cd /tmp; apt download aide-common 
  
Fetch the SHA1 of the original script file: 
  
     $ dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile /tmp/aide-common_*.deb | tar -xO ./usr/share/aide/config/cron.daily/aide | sha1sum

Compare with the SHA1 of the file in the daily or monthly cron directory:  
  
     $ sha1sum /etc/cron.{daily,monthly}/aide 2>/dev/null 
     b71bb2cafaedf15ec3ac2f566f209d3260a37af0  /etc/cron.daily/aide 
  
If there is no AIDE script file in the cron directories, or the SHA1 value of at least one file in the daily or monthly cron directory does not match the SHA1 of the original, this is a finding.'
