Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).'

To reload the rules file, issue the following command:

Note: The "-k <keyname>" at the end of the line gives the rule a unique meaning to help during an audit investigation. The <keyname> does not need to match the example above.'
