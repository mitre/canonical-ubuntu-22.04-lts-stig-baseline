If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

Note: The "-k" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example output above.'

Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/stig.rules" file:

-w /usr/sbin/fdisk -p x -k fdisk

To reload the rules file, issue the following command:

     $ sudo augenrules --load

Note: The "-k <keyname>" at the end of the line gives the rule a unique meaning to help during an audit investigation. The <keyname> does not need to match the example above.'
